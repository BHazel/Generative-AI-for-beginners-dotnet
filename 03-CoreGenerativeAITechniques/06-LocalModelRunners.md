# Running AI Models Locally: AI Toolkit, Docker, and Foundry Local

In this lesson, you'll learn how to run AI models locally using three popular approaches:
- **[AI Toolkit for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/toolkit/)** ‚Äì A suite of tools for Windows that enables running AI models locally
- **[Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/model-runner/)** ‚Äì A containerized approach for running AI models with Docker
- **[Foundry Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/)** ‚Äì A cross-platform, open-source solution for running Microsoft AI models locally

Running models locally provides several benefits:
- Data privacy ‚Äì Your data never leaves your machine
- Cost efficiency ‚Äì No usage charges for API calls
- Offline availability ‚Äì Use AI even without internet connectivity
- Customization ‚Äì Fine-tune models for specific use cases

## AI Toolkit for Windows

The AI Toolkit for Windows is a collection of tools and technologies that help you build and run AI applications locally on Windows PCs. It leverages the Windows platform capabilities to optimize AI workloads.

### Key Features
- **DirectML** ‚Äì Hardware-accelerated machine learning primitives
- **Windows AI Runtime (WinRT)** ‚Äì Runtime environment for AI models
- **ONNX Runtime** ‚Äì Cross-platform inference accelerator
- **Local model downloads** ‚Äì Access to optimized models for Windows

### Getting Started
1. [Install the AI Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/toolkit/install)
2. Download a supported model
3. Use the APIs through .NET or other supported languages

> üìù **Note**: AI Toolkit for Windows requires Windows 10/11 and compatible hardware for optimal performance.

## Docker Model Runner

Docker Model Runner is a tool for running AI models in containers, making it easy to deploy and run inference workloads consistently across different environments.

### Key Features

- **Containerized models** ‚Äì Package models with their dependencies
- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Built-in API** ‚Äì RESTful API for model interaction
- **Resource management** ‚Äì Control CPU and memory usage

### Getting Started

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Pull a model image
3. Run the model container
4. Interact with the model through the API

```bash
# Pull and run a Llama model
docker run -d -p 12434:8080 \
  --name deepseek-model \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  ghcr.io/huggingface/dockerfiles/model-runner:latest \
  deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat
```

## Foundry Local

[Foundry Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/) is an open-source, cross-platform solution for running Microsoft AI models on your own hardware. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is designed for privacy, performance, and flexibility.

### Key Features

- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Microsoft models** ‚Äì Run models from Azure AI Foundry locally
- **REST API** ‚Äì Interact with models using a local API endpoint
- **No cloud dependency** ‚Äì All inference runs on your machine

### Getting Started

1. [Read the official Foundry Local documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/)
2. Download and install Foundry Local for your OS
3. Start the Foundry Local server and download a model
4. Use the REST API to interact with the model

## Sample Code: Using AI Toolkit for Windows with .NET

The AI Toolkit for Windows provides a way to run AI models locally on Windows machines. We have two examples that demonstrate how to interact with AI Toolkit models using .NET:

### 1. Semantic Kernel with AI Toolkit

The [AIToolkit-01-SK-Chat](./src/AIToolkit-01-SK-Chat/) project shows how to use Semantic Kernel to chat with a model running via AI Toolkit for Windows.

```csharp
// Example code demonstrating AI Toolkit with Semantic Kernel integration
var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
// Configure to use a locally installed model through AI Toolkit
builder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
    modelId: modelId,
    endpoint: new Uri(endpoint),
    apiKey: apiKey);
var kernel = builder.Build();
// Create a chat history and use it with the kernel
```

### 2. Microsoft Extensions for AI with AI Toolkit

The [AIToolkit-02-MEAI-Chat](./src/AIToolkit-02-MEAI-Chat/) project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Extensions for AI to interact with AI Toolkit models.

```csharp
// Example code demonstrating AI Toolkit with MEAI
OpenAIClientOptions options = new OpenAIClientOptions();
options.Endpoint = new Uri(endpoint);
ApiKeyCredential credential = new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey);
// Create a chat client using local model through AI Toolkit
ChatClient client = new OpenAIClient(credential, options).GetChatClient(modelId);
```

## Sample Code: Using Docker Models with .NET

In this repository, we have two examples that demonstrate how to interact with Docker-based models using .NET:

### 1. Semantic Kernel with Docker Models

The [DockerModels-01-SK-Chat](./src/DockerModels-01-SK-Chat/) project shows how to use Semantic Kernel to chat with a model running in Docker.

```csharp
var model = "ai/deepseek-r1-distill-llama";
var base_url = "http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1";
var api_key = "unused";

// Create a chat completion service
var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
builder.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(modelId: model, apiKey: api_key, endpoint: new Uri(base_url));
var kernel = builder.Build();

var chat = kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>();
var history = new ChatHistory();
history.AddSystemMessage("You are a useful chatbot. Always reply in a funny way with short answers.");

// ... continue with chat functionality
```

### 2. Microsoft Extensions for AI with Docker Models

The [DockerModels-02-MEAI-Chat](./src/DockerModels-02-MEAI-Chat/) project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Extensions for AI to interact with Docker-based models.

```csharp
var model = "ai/deepseek-r1-distill-llama";
var base_url = "http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1";
var api_key = "unused";

OpenAIClientOptions options = new OpenAIClientOptions();
options.Endpoint = new Uri(base_url);
ApiKeyCredential credential = new ApiKeyCredential(api_key);

ChatClient client = new OpenAIClient(credential, options).GetChatClient(model);

// Build and send a prompt
StringBuilder prompt = new StringBuilder();
prompt.AppendLine("You will analyze the sentiment of the following product reviews...");
// ... add more text to the prompt

var response = await client.CompleteChatAsync(prompt.ToString());
Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content[0].Text);
```
